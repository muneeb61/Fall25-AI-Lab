    "## Mini Project 2 â€” Movie Budget Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the given list of movies, where each item is a tuple containing:\n",
    "   - Movie name\n",
    "   - Movie budget\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the **average budget** of all movies in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Print out every movie that has a **budget higher than the average** you calculated.  \n",
    "   - Also print how much higher than the average the movie's budget was.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print out **how many movies** spent more than the average you calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extra Challenge:**  \n",
    "   - Allow users to add more movies to the dataset before running the calculations.  \n",
    "   - Ask the user how many movies they want to add.  \n",
    "   - Use a `for` loop with `range` to repeat input collection.  \n",
    "   - Inside the loop, take input for the movie name and budget, and append this as a tuple to the list.\n"
